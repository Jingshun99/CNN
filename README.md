# CNN

This project introduces possible solutions that could be implemented to increase the accuracy of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) with a small sample size.


## Environment:
- Windows 10 64-bit
- Python 3.9.7
- Visual Studio code

To start, run main.ipynb using Jupyter notebook or Google Colab.

***Table of Content*** decsribes what each cell is doing.

To make prediction on own image, add your image into the ***image*** subfolder, and replace the **_<img_pth>_** in cell 27 with your image path.

All the trained model will be saved in the ***weights*** subfolder and the output figures will be saved in the ***output*** subfolder.
